UltimateAWUserGuide
===================

The Ultimate AW User Guide is a modification made to the official AW User Guide which enhances it by adding newer, more relevant categories and new features such as wiki inclusion and a comprehensive teleports list. 

This takes the place of the existing user guide, which may be found in the AW tabs menu by pressing F9 and looking under the 'User Guide'/'Help' tab.

The Ultimate AW User Guide won a Cy Award on November 13, 2010 for Best Bot/Software.

### Installation

The Default.AWH file should be moved to...

    C:/ > Active Worlds > Help

...and replace the existing default.awh file.  You may rename the existing file 'defaultbackup' if you want to preserve it.  ActiveWorlds will need to be restarted for this to take effect.


### Older Versions

The previous home of the Ultimate AW User Guide can be found at the [SW City Builder's Academy]( http://www.swcity.net/academy/index.php?n=Main.UltimateAWUserGuide)
